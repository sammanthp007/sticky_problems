#Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. 
#Note: This is not a necessarily a binary search tree

def find(tree, node1, node2):
    
    
psudo:
    see if one of the node is a child of the other
    if not:
        go to the parent of one of the node, and see to the other side if there is another node
        
        
        
# nodes : value, leftptr, rightptr

#On an old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keyboard and the phone would provide a list of words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of 0-4 letters.Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is sent to you as a picture in facebook:

#input: 8733
#output: tree, used

t9letters = {null, null, {'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'d', 'e', 'f'}, {'g','h','i'}, {'j','k','l'}, {'m','n','o'}, }


print getvalidT9words("8733", setwordlist)
setwordlist = {"tree", "used", "prek""shak", "interview", "ok"}
