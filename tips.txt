notes:

1) If sorted list then see if we can make use of binary search

2) if binary tree:
    a) See if there is any property of a binary tree we can make use of
    b) See how to approach theoritically, don't start writing code at all until you are 100% sure of it.

3) if binary search tree:
    a) See if there are any properties of a binary search tree we can make use of
    b) Look at it from a normal eye, talk through it. Just make sure that you get to a clear solution with no problem before even thinking about writing code.
